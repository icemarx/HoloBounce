## TODO: How to use the game on the device

## How to charge the device (based on our experience):
To charge:
  1. plug it into an outlet (micro usb)
  2. turn off the device
  3. check if the device is still turned off (after a minute or two)
  4. charge for about 10h

After charging:
  1. wait a minute
  2. Turn off the device

Notes: DO NOT have the device on while charging, as the battery depletes faster than it charges.
